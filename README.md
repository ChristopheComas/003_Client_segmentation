Here are three key points summarizing the data scientist's work on the project:
The task involves providing Olist's e-commerce teams with a customer segmentation to enhance their daily communication campaigns. This segmentation is based on analyzing user behavior and personal data.
The deliverables include an actionable description of the segmentation and its underlying logic for the Marketing team. Additionally, a proposal for a maintenance contract is required, based on an analysis of segment stability over time.
An anonymized dataset is provided, containing information on order history, purchased products, satisfaction comments, and customer location since January 2017. Unsupervised methods will be used to cluster customers with similar profiles, which will assist the Marketing team in improving their communication strategies.
